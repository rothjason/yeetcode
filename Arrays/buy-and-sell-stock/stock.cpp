/*
Objective: Design an algorithm that looks at an array of stock prices and determines
the maximum possible profit

Givens:
-Only able to buy on another day until first purchase is sold
-May buy/sell on as many days as possible

Algorithm Prototype:
int buy = 0;
int sell = 0;
int i = 0;
  while(v.size > 1){
    if(v[i] < v[i+1] && buy == 0){

    }

    v.pop_front(); //pass by the day
  }
