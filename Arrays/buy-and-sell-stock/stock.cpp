/*
Objective: Design an algorithm that looks at an array of stock prices and determines
the maximum possible profit

Givens:
-Only able to buy on another day until first purchase is sold
-May buy/sell on as many days as possible
-May sell then buy on the same day

Algorithm Prototype:
int profit = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++){
  if(v[i] < v[i+1]){
    profit += v[i+1]-v[i]
  }
}
return profit
